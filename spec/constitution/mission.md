# MISSION: GPU Rendering Pipeline (Bounty #13475)

## OBJECTIVE
Deliver a robust, automated pipeline to render Blender animations using the dedicated RTX 5070 GPU render node. This solution bridges the existing Bottube AI-prompting logic with high-performance hardware rendering.

## CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **Automation:** No manual frame processing or CLI-heavy interventions.
2. **Standardization:** All outputs must be H.264/MP4 compliant for immediate pipeline consumption.
3. **SDD Compliance:** All logic must be documented, planned, and verified against the specs before execution.
4. **Non-Intrusiveness:** Do not alter the core functionality of existing libraries (e.g., `lib/retro90s_blender.py`).
